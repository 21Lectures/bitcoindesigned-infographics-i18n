THE BITCOIN MINING SAGA - PART II

What is Proof of Work (PoW)?

It’s a method to ensure that the information (the new block) was difficult (costly, time-consuming) to be made.

It costs processing power.

Which can be translated to: hardware, energy and time.

It’s easy, on the other hand, for others to check if the requirements were met.
