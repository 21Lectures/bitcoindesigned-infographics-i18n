"Node decentralization is essential for a healthy Bitcoin. But not just any "
"node, an economically active full node."
msgstr ""

#: source-text.txt:26
msgid ""
"The nodes that really make a difference in the decision of protocol changes "
"are the ones that accept transactions and validate them using their own full "
"nodes, usually merchants. That’s what we call the economic majority."
msgstr ""

#: source-text.txt:28
msgid ""
"If there were fewer merchants, there would be fewer people to enforce "
"Bitcoin’s consensus rules, leaving it more prone to manipulation."

"With a centralized mining, the inclusion of transactions in the blockchain "

msgstr ""

#: source-text.txt:42
msgid ""
"Operations that hold too much mining power can effectively censor and, at "

"One of the considered wepons against centralized mining is a thoroughly "

"Most nodes currently use one single Bitcoin implementation, that’s quite "

"The centralization of development has worked well until now, but it’s "

"The protection against this lies in the fact that the code is open and "

#: source-text.txt:70
msgid ""
"Even though they are not a fundamental part of Bitcoin’s existence, "
"exchanges have a relevant role since they are the main interface with the "
"traditional economic system."
msgstr ""

#: source-text.txt:72
msgid ""
"As for custodial wallets, they are chosen, many times, by users who don’t "
"want or don’t know how to protect their private keys. So they outsource the "
"responsibility to a company."
msgstr ""

#: source-text.txt:74
msgid ""
"In both cases, the more centralized they are, the easier it is to steal "
"funds from a large number of people and cause a market disruption as they "
"become huge honeypots for attackers."
msgstr ""

#: source-text.txt:76
msgid ""
"Decentralized and non-custodial exchanges, and non-custodial wallets are a "

msgid "So what is the conclusion here?"
msgstr ""

#: source-text.txt:80
msgid ""
"Bitcoin is still well enough to keep going for now. But it should be an "
"ongoing concern to take care of its degree of decentralization and the "
"attack vectors originated by it."

msgid ""
"Otherwise, we’ll be just waiting for a time bomb to go off when some of "
"these elements get out of control."
