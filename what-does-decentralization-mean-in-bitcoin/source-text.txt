What does Decentralization mean in bitcoin?

bitcoindesigned.com

Bitcoin is called decentralized because it has no central point of control.

Its resources (hardware and software) are distributed around the world and connected remotely in a network.

And the “authority” to decide over Bitcoin is divided between its network participants.

Who are the participants?

The shared responsibility includes the following agents:

Nodes

Transaction is valid

Verify and relay transactions.

Miners

Secure transactions by writing and ordering them on the blockchain in exchange for fees and newly minted bitcoins.

Until the ~21 million limit is reached.

Both roles can be played by anyone willing to commit the resources to it, there’s no permission to be asked.

Look, I’m mining.

What are the implications?

Miners and nodes are responsible for a decentralized economic policy, replacing the need for a central bank to take care of currency issuance and clearing functions.

Permanent vacation

Bitcoin’s decentralization is a protection against a single point of failure.

That means it’s robust in face of external intervention because there’s no single entity to be attacked or corrupted.

Where do we attack?

But this decentralization is not a guaranteed feature and there are risks to it as well.

We’ll explore some of these issues in the continuation of this infographic.
