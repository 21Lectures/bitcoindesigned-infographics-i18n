What does Censorship resistance mean in Bitcoin?

You’ve probably heard a bitcoiner talk about Bitcoin’s censorship resistance, but what does it really mean?

Well, it means that Bitcoin transactions can’t be censored. That was easy, right?

Free Bitcoin

But isn’t censorship usually about suppressing free speech or information? What does money have to do with that?

The way you spend your money is an expression of yourself (your values, habits, etc). Money is actually a form of speech.

Here’s a traditional system simulation:

Let’s say you want to support an NGO that has a particular ideology.

The government from your country decides it doesn’t approve that ideology.

An official statement tells financial institutions that they shouldn’t allow
transactions to the NGO.

The institutions oblige and you are blocked from spending money in a cause you believe in.

You’re actually being

censored

This can happen in other circumstances that don’t involve much ideology, such as wanting to buy prohibited drugs.

In Bitcoin, as long as the network is decentralized, nodes will relay your transaction and miners will compete to add your transaction to the blockchain.

It might not be a very glamorous definition, but Bitcoin’s censorship resistance is ultimately about being able to

spend your money on whatever you want.

And that isn’t just something that was added by an incident to Bitcoin.

It’s one of the reasons it was created in the first place.

Free money
