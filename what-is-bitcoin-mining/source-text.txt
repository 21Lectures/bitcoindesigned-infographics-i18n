THE BITCOIN MINING SAGA - PART I

What is Bitcoin Mining?

It’s a decentralized computational process that serves 2 purposes:

Confirms transactions with security when enough computational effort is devoted to a block.

Creates (issues) new bitcoins in each block.

It goes like this:

Bundle transactions in a block.

Verify if transactions are valid.

Select the header of the most recent block and insert it into the new block as a hash (creates a link between blocks).

Solve the Proof of Work problem!

When the solution is found, the new block is added to the local blockchain and propagated to the network.
