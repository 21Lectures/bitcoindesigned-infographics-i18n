regular wallet

One key is required to authorize money transfer, i.e. sign a transaction.

Multisig wallet

More than one key may be required to sign each transaction.

m-of-n

The m-of-n scheme means that the wallet is associated with m keys and each time a transaction needs to be broadcast, n of those m keys need to sign it.

m keys

m = 4

n signatures

n = 3

What’s the point?

The main use case for multisig wallets is to increase security of funds.

Examples

Decentralizing risks independently.

John associates his wallet with two keys, each stored in a different machine. If one machine is hacked, he won’t loose his bitcoins instantly.

Security with redundancy.

Lisa has a 2-of-3 wallet address and keeps the 3 keys in separate places to avoid theft. If one of the keys is lost, she can still access her bitcoins.

Bank

Decentralizing risks with help.

Sophie’s business has a multisig address and shares the responsibility of signing transactions with a security specialized company that holds one of the needed keys for spending. So if Sophie is hacked, her coins are still protected.

Managing trust.

Company LOL has a 3-of-5 Bitcoin wallet with its resources and each key is hold by one of its executives. In order to move money, 3 of them have to sign the transaction, making sure at least the majority agrees with the spending.
